# Singapore Public Transport Guide for Students

## Overview

Singapore has one of the best public transport systems in Asia. The MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) and bus network covers the entire island, and you rarely need a taxi or private car. As a student, you'll spend around $60-130 per month on transport.

## Money-Saving Tips

### Free Transfers

Transfer between MRT and bus (or bus to bus) within 45 minutes and you only pay the combined distance fare — not two separate fares. Up to 5 transfers are allowed per journey.

**Example:** MRT from Clementi to Buona Vista ($0.77) + Bus from Buona Vista to NUS ($0.57) = combined fare of about $1.00, not $0.77 + $0.57 = $1.34

### Off-Peak Discounts

- Travel before 7:45 AM on weekdays for discounted fares
- Weekends and public holidays generally have lower ridership

### Monthly Pass

- The Adult Monthly Travel Pass costs $128 for unlimited MRT + bus rides
- Only worth it if you spend more than $128/month (roughly 3+ trips per day)
- Most students with concession cards spend $60-80/month, so the pass may not be necessary

### Campus Shuttles

- **NUS:** Free shuttle buses connect Kent Ridge, Buona Vista, Clementi, and campus buildings
- **NTU:** Campus Rider connects Pioneer MRT to NTU campus
- **SMU:** City campus is walkable from several MRT stations (Bras Basah, City Hall, Dhoby Ghaut)
