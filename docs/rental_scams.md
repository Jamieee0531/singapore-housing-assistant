# Rental Scam Prevention Guide for International Students

## How Serious Is the Problem?

Rental scams in Singapore have increased significantly in recent years. In 2022 alone, 979 cases were reported. Between January and October 2024, more than 430 cases were reported with total losses exceeding $2.7 million. International students are particularly vulnerable because they often search for housing remotely before arriving in Singapore.

## Common Scam Types

### 1. Fake Property Listings

**How it works:** Scammers post attractive listings on social media or property websites with below-market rental prices. They request an upfront deposit to "secure" the room, then disappear after receiving payment.

**Red flags:**
- Price is significantly below market rate (e.g., a master room in Orchard for $500/month)
- Listing photos look too professional or are taken from other websites
- Vague property descriptions with no specific address
- Landlord refuses to provide their full name or identification

### 2. Fake Agent Impersonation

**How it works:** Scammers impersonate registered property agents by stealing their CEA registration numbers, business cards, and photos. They post fake listings and collect deposits from multiple victims.

**Red flags:**
- Agent's phone number doesn't match the CEA register
- They communicate only through messaging apps, never phone calls
- They can't answer specific questions about the property

### 3. The Fake Keys Scam

**How it works:** A scammer rents a property and shows students around while living there, making it look legitimate. After collecting a deposit and first month's rent, they give the victim fake keys. When the victim tries to move in, the keys don't work and the scammer has vanished.

**Red flags:**
- The person showing you the property seems to live there but claims to be "moving out"
- They rush you to pay before you've signed any paperwork
- They don't have a proper tenancy agreement prepared

### 4. Unauthorized Subletting

**How it works:** Someone rents a property and illegally sublets rooms without the landlord's knowledge. Victims may face eviction once the landlord discovers the unauthorized subletting.

**Red flags:**
- The person renting to you is not the property owner
- They don't have a tenancy agreement with the owner or HDB approval
- Multiple rooms are being rented out with different "landlords"

### 5. Pressure Tactics

**How it works:** Scammers claim the property is in extremely high demand and pressure you to pay a "blocking fee" or deposit immediately, before you've had time to verify anything.

**Red flags:**
- "Pay now or lose it" — extreme urgency
- Request for a "blocking fee" before viewing
- Won't let you take photos or bring a friend to the viewing
- Insists on cash payment or personal bank transfer

## How to Protect Yourself

### Before You Start Searching

1. **Research market rates** for your desired area so you can spot unrealistically low prices
2. **Use reputable platforms only:** PropertyGuru, 99.co, Carousell Property, or your university's official housing portal
3. **Never pay any money before arriving in Singapore** — no exceptions

### During Your Search

4. **Always view the property in person.** If you can't, ask a trusted friend in Singapore to view it for you. You should never have to pay to view a property.

5. **Verify the agent's credentials:**
   - Go to CEA's Public Register: https://www.cea.gov.sg/aceas/public-register
   - Search the agent's name and registration number
   - Confirm their photo, company, and contact details match

6. **Check property ownership:**
   - For HDB: Use HDB's e-Service portal to verify the flat exists
   - For private property: Check Singapore Land Authority's INLIS service
   - Ask the landlord to show their property ownership documents

7. **Meet the actual landlord or authorized agent**, not a friend or representative

### Before Signing

8. **Never pay before signing a proper Tenancy Agreement (TA).** A proper TA should include:
   - Full names and identification numbers of landlord and tenant
   - Property address and description
   - Rental amount, deposit amount, and payment terms
   - Lease duration and renewal terms
   - Responsibilities for maintenance and repairs
   - Terms for early termination

9. **Pay only via bank transfer to verified accounts**, never cash. Keep all payment records.

10. **Get a receipt for every payment** — deposit, rent, agent fee, etc.
