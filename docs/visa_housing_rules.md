# Student Pass, Visa & Housing Rules in Singapore

## Student Pass Basics

### What is a Student Pass?

A Student Pass (STP) is issued by the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to international students enrolled in full-time courses at approved educational institutions in Singapore. It allows you to legally stay and study in Singapore.

### Eligibility

You need a Student Pass if you are:
- A foreign national accepted into a full-time course in Singapore
- Studying at an approved institution (NUS, NTU, SMU, SUTD, SIT, polytechnics, etc.)
- Enrolled in a course that is NOT part-time, evening-only, or weekend-only

### Application Process

1. Your institution submits the Student Pass application on your behalf through ICA's SOLAR system
2. ICA issues an In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter
3. You enter Singapore using the IPA letter as a temporary travel document
4. Within 2 weeks of arriving, complete the Student Pass formalities at ICA
5. Receive your Student Pass card (this is your official identification in Singapore)

### Important Documents to Keep

- Student Pass card (carry at all times)
- IPA letter (keep a copy even after receiving your Student Pass)
- Passport (valid for at least 6 months beyond your study period)
- University acceptance letter
- SOLAR application reference number

## Housing Eligibility for Student Pass Holders

### Can You Rent a Home with a Student Pass?

Yes. Student Pass holders are eligible to rent in Singapore, but the rules differ depending on the type of property.

### HDB Flat Rental Rules

HDB flats (public housing) have stricter rules:

**Requirements:**
- Your Student Pass must be valid for at least 6 months from the date of rental application
- The landlord must have obtained approval from HDB before renting to you
- The flat must not exceed the non-citizen tenant quota for that block

**Key Restrictions:**
- Minimum lease period: 6 months
- Maximum lease period: 2 years (can be renewed)
- Subletting is not allowed — you must rent directly from the approved tenant/owner
- The landlord must register you as an occupier with HDB

**What to Ask Your Landlord:**
- "Do you have HDB approval to rent this flat/room?"
- "Has the non-citizen quota been checked for this block?"
- "Can I see the HDB approval letter?"

### Private Property Rental Rules

Condominiums and private apartments have fewer restrictions:

- Minimum lease period: 3 months (but most landlords prefer 6-12 months)
- No non-citizen quota
- Subletting is allowed with the owner's written consent
- Landlords still need to verify you have a valid Student Pass

### On-Campus Housing

- Apply through your university's student housing portal
- Usually the cheapest option: $400-1,000/month
- Limited availability — apply early (2-3 months before semester starts)
- Priority may be given to first-year students or those from overseas
- Meals may be included in some residence halls

## Rental Agreement Essentials

### What Must Be in Your Tenancy Agreement

A proper tenancy agreement should include:

1. **Parties:** Full names and identification numbers (NRIC/FIN/Passport) of landlord and tenant
2. **Property:** Full address and description of the property or room
3. **Rent:** Monthly rental amount and payment due date
4. **Deposit:** Security deposit amount (typically 1-2 months' rent)
5. **Duration:** Start and end dates of the lease
6. **Renewal:** Terms for extending the lease
7. **Termination:** Conditions for early termination and notice period
8. **Maintenance:** Who is responsible for repairs and maintenance
9. **Utilities:** Who pays for electricity, water, gas, and internet
10. **Rules:** Any house rules (guests, smoking, cooking, quiet hours)

### Stamp Duty

All tenancy agreements in Singapore must be stamped with IRAS (Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore) to be legally valid.

**Who pays:** Usually the tenant, but this is negotiable.

**Cost calculation:**
- Leases up to 4 years: 0.4% of total rent

**Example:**
- Rent: $1,000/month for 12 months = $12,000 total rent
- Stamp duty: $12,000 x 0.4% = $48

**How to pay:** Through IRAS e-Stamping portal (https://estamping.iras.gov.sg) within 14 days of signing the agreement.

### Deposit Rules

- **Amount:** Typically 1 month's rent for a 1-year lease, 2 months' rent for a 2-year lease
- **Purpose:** Covers damages, unpaid rent, or unpaid utilities
- **Return:** Should be refunded within 7-14 days after you move out, minus any legitimate deductions
- **Tip:** Take photos of the property's condition when you move in and when you move out as evidence
