# Utilities Setup Guide: Water, Electricity, Gas & Internet

## Overview

When you move into a new rental in Singapore, you'll need to set up basic utilities: electricity, water, gas, and internet. This guide covers everything you need to know as a new tenant.

**Important:** In many rental situations, especially when renting a room in an HDB flat or condo, the landlord handles the utility account and charges you a fixed monthly amount (e.g., $50-100 for utilities) or splits the bill. Confirm this with your landlord before setting up your own accounts.

## Electricity, Water & Gas: SP Services

### What is SP Services?

SP Services (Singapore Power) is the main utility provider. You can manage electricity, water, and gas through a single SP account — no need to apply separately to PUB (Public Utilities Board) or City Energy.

### When You Need Your Own Account

You need to open your own SP account if:
- You're renting a whole unit (not just a room)
- Your landlord requires you to have your own utility account
- You're the main tenant taking over from a previous occupant

### How to Open an Account

**Online (Recommended):**
1. Download the SP Utilities App (iOS/Android) or visit the SP Utilities Portal
2. Log in using Singpass (MyInfo) — this auto-fills your details
3. Choose your move-in date
4. Pay the security deposit
5. Book an appointment for utility activation

**In Person:**
- Visit an SP Customer Service Centre with your NRIC/FIN and tenancy agreement

**Documents Required:**
- NRIC or FIN (Foreign Identification Number)
- Tenancy Agreement or Letter of Authorization from landlord
- Singpass login (for online application)

### Security Deposit

- Amount: $40-200+ depending on property type
- Higher for larger units
- Refundable when you close the account (minus any outstanding bills)

### Activation Timeline

- Online application: about 7 working days for activation
- You'll receive an SMS confirmation and email before the appointment
- A technician will come to turn on water and check electrical safety
- **BTO flats:** Utilities are already activated, no appointment needed

## Estimated Monthly Utility Costs

| Utility | HDB Room (1 person) | HDB Whole Unit (2-3 people) | Condo Unit |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Electricity | $30-60 | $80-150 | $100-200 |
| Water | $10-20 | $30-50 | $30-60 |
| Gas | $5-15 | $15-30 | $15-35 |
| **Total** | **$45-95** | **$125-230** | **$145-295** |

### What Affects Your Electricity Bill

The biggest factor is **air conditioning:**
- Running aircon 8 hours/night: adds $50-100/month to your bill
- Running aircon all day: adds $150-250/month
- Using a fan instead: minimal cost ($2-5/month)

**Saving Tips:**
- Set aircon temperature to 25°C (not lower)
- Use a timer to turn off aircon after you fall asleep
- Turn off lights and appliances when not in use
- Use a fan for most of the day, aircon only at night

### Water Conservation

Singapore treats water as a precious resource. Utility rates include:
- Water tariff
- Water conservation tax (30% of water tariff)
- Waterborne fee (sanitary and drainage)

**Saving Tips:**
- Take shorter showers (5-10 minutes)
- Don't leave the tap running while brushing teeth
- Report any leaks to your landlord immediately

## Gas Options

### Piped Gas (City Energy)

Most HDB flats use piped gas for cooking. After your SP account is set up, call City Energy at 1800 555 1661 to activate gas.

### No Gas Needed?

Many newer condos use induction stoves, which run on electricity — no gas account needed. Check with your landlord what type of stove your unit has.

### LPG Cylinder Gas

Some older HDB flats use LPG gas cylinders. These are purchased and delivered separately. Your landlord should inform you about this.

## Internet / Broadband

### Main Providers

| Provider | Starting Price | Highlights |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Singtel | $39.90/month | Largest network, bundle options |
| StarHub | $34.90/month | Competitive pricing, TV bundles |
| M1 | $36.90/month | Good customer service |
| ViewQwest | $39.99/month | No-contract plans, gaming-focused |

### What Speed Do You Need?

- Basic browsing and streaming: 300 Mbps ($30-40/month)
- Gaming and multiple users: 1 Gbps ($40-55/month)
- Heavy use / work from home: 2 Gbps ($50-70/month)

**For most students sharing a flat:** 1 Gbps is more than enough, split between 2-3 people = $15-20 each.

### Setup Process

1. Choose a provider and plan online
2. Schedule an installation appointment (usually within 1-2 weeks)
3. A technician will install the router and activate the connection
4. **Important:** Inform your provider at least 1 month in advance if you need to transfer your broadband to a new address

### Contract vs No-Contract

- **Contract plans (12-24 months):** Lower monthly price, but early termination fee if you leave
- **No-contract plans:** Slightly higher monthly price, but more flexibility
- **Recommendation for students:** Choose no-contract or match the contract length to your lease period

## Common Tenant Questions

### Who pays for utilities?

This depends on your rental agreement. Common arrangements:

1. **Fixed utility charge:** Landlord charges you a flat fee (e.g., $100/month) regardless of actual usage — common for room rentals
2. **Split by usage:** All tenants split the actual utility bill equally — common for whole-unit rentals
3. **Included in rent:** Some landlords include basic utilities in the rent — always confirm what's included
4. **Your own account:** You open your own SP account and pay directly — common for whole-unit rentals

### What about aircon servicing?

- Aircon units need servicing every 3-6 months
- Many tenancy agreements require tenants to arrange and pay for aircon servicing
- Cost: $20-40 per unit per servicing session
- Keep receipts — your landlord may check at the end of your lease

### What if something breaks?

- **Landlord's responsibility:** Major structural issues, plumbing, electrical wiring, appliances that came with the unit (if over $150 to repair)
- **Tenant's responsibility:** Minor repairs under $150, lightbulb replacements, aircon servicing
- **Always:** Inform your landlord in writing (text or email) about any issues — don't try to fix major problems yourself

### Transferring utilities when moving out

1. Notify your landlord at least 1 month before moving out
2. If you have your own SP account, apply to close it on your move-out date
3. Take final meter readings (photos are helpful)
4. Cancel or transfer your internet plan
5. Your security deposit will be refunded after final bills are settled
